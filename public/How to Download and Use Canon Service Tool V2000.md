## How to Use Canon Service Tool V2000
 
Before using Canon Service Tool V2000, you need to put your printer in service mode. This will allow the program to communicate with your printer and perform the service operations. The procedure for entering service mode may vary depending on your printer model and software version, but here is a general guide:

1. Turn off your printer by pressing the power button. Do not disconnect any cables from the printer.
2. Press and hold the stop button (the red triangle) and quickly press and hold the power button. Do not release the buttons.
3. When the power LED lights in green, release the stop button but keep holding the power button.
4. Press the stop button twice and then release both the power and stop buttons. The power LED should still be green and the LCD display should show two lines of text: "Service mode" and "Idle".
5. If your printer has a TFT screen, you may need to press other buttons instead of the stop button. Refer to your printer's manual or service manual for more details.
